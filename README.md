<h1 align="center">Hello 👋, This is a Solo Submission for <br> Hackbio Internship 2021 😎</h1>
<h3> Don't you know what this internship is?</h3>
👉 It's a virtual internship on Bioinformatics that will last for 5 weeks <br>
👉 And we, the interns are from around the world <br>
👉 Reach to Hackbio Team on  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hackbio">Linkedin </a><br>

<h3>Oh! I haven’t still introduced myself 🥺</h3>

✨ I’m Nishat Tamanna and I love Bioinformatics <br>
✨ And I’m from the beautiful country, Bangladesh <br>
✨ Wanna reach me? Just mail me at nishattamanna51@gmail.com 🥰  

<h3>Goal of this Project </h3>

<p>We were told to choose any programming language and write small scripts that will print - name, e-mail, slack handle, biostack, twitter handle and hamming distance between the two handles.</p>
<p>And each team must use at least 7 different programming languages. As a solo member, I used only one, that is BASH.</p>
<p>After pushing the scripts to the team’s git repository, collaboratively as a team we were told to generate a CSV file from all the outputs of the team's scripts.</p>

<h1 align="center">Let me show how you should accomplish <br> the task all by yourself </h1>

<h1>Prerequisites </h1>
<ul>
✴️ Ubuntu operating system <br>
✴️ Github account <br>
✴️ Git for Ubuntu 

</ul> 

<h3>Check whether you’ve pre-installed git </h3>
<p>Run “git --version” command from the Ubuntu Command prompt. If you’ve already installed git, it will show you the git version.</p>

<h3>Working with the github repo</h3>
<ul>
✴️ Create a github repository with a name you like on your github account.<br>
✴️ In your repo, using the option “Add file”, upload your script (mine is Stage_0_nishat.sh) and commit changes<br>
 

</ul> 

<h3>Working with Ubuntu CLI</h3>
<ul>
✴️ Connect your git to github account <br>
<br> ✴️ Write a bash script to generate the CSV file:<br>
    Using nano editor create a bash script that will-
    <br>
    <ul> <br>
      👉 Clone the repository using that script<br>
      👉 Run the uploaded script <br>
      👉 And redirect the output of that script into a CSV file <br>
      👉 For the code, check my file Script_for_generating_csv.sh <br>
    </ul>
 
<br> ✴️ Make the script executable
 <ul>👉 Run “chmod +x file_name
    </ul> <br>
✴️ Run the bash script and get your CSV file <br>
</ul> 

 <h1 align=”center”>❤️ Thank You ❤️</h1>

<h1>Fun Fact</h1>😜
<p>I didn’t know bash scripting, I only knew Python & C programming. I took it as a challenge to work with a new language. 💪</p>
<p>SO, if you are a novice coder, you can also take challenges and check how far you can go! 💪</p>
